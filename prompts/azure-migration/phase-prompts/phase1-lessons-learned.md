# Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup - Lessons Learned

## Executive Summary

This document captures the real-world lessons learned from deploying AI-generated Terraform infrastructure for migrating a Java Authorization Server from AWS to Azure. The deployment was successful after addressing several Azure-specific limitations and best practices that were not apparent in the initial AI-generated code.

**Key Success Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure deployed successfully** in West US region
- ‚úÖ **Total deployment time**: ~35-40 minutes
- ‚úÖ **Monthly cost**: ~$10-25 (Consumption plan) vs ~$35-50 (Basic plan)
- ‚úÖ **All components functional**: Function Apps, API Management, Key Vault, Monitoring

## Critical Issues Discovered & Resolved

### 1. üö® Java Runtime Version Incompatibility

#### **Issue Discovered**
```bash
Error: expected site_config.0.application_stack.0.java_version to be one of ["8" "11" "17"], got 21
```

#### **Root Cause**
- AI initially suggested Java 21 (latest LTS)
- Azure Functions only supports Java 8, 11, and 17
- Java 21 support not yet available on Azure platform

#### **Solution Implemented**
```hcl
# Before (AI generated)
java_version = "21"

# After (Production ready)
java_version = "17"  # Latest supported version

# Added validation
validation {
  condition     = contains(["8", "11", "17"], var.java_version)
  error_message = "Java version must be 8, 11, or 17 (Azure Functions supported versions)."
}
```

#### **Impact**
- ‚úÖ **Prevented deployment failure**
- ‚úÖ **Uses latest supported Java version**
- ‚úÖ **Future-proofs with validation**

### 2. üè∑Ô∏è Azure Resource Naming Limitations

#### **Issue Discovered**
```bash
Error: "kv-authserver-dev-eastus-vx9" is too long. Key Vault name must be between 3-24 characters
```

#### **Root Cause**
- AI used verbose naming: `kv-authserver-dev-eastus-vx9` (27 characters)
- Key Vault names limited to **24 characters maximum**
- Storage account names also limited to 24 characters

#### **Solution Implemented**
```hcl
# Before (AI generated - 27 chars)
name = "kv-authserver-dev-eastus-vx9"

# After (Production ready - 21 chars)
name = "kv-authserver-deveusvx9"

# Pattern: kv-<project><env><region><suffix>
# Added dynamic naming with length checks
```

#### **Impact**
- ‚úÖ **Complies with Azure naming limits**
- ‚úÖ **Maintains uniqueness with random suffix**
- ‚úÖ **Prevents naming-related deployment failures**

---

### 3. üåç Regional Quota Limitations

#### **Issue Discovered**
```bash
Error: Operation cannot be completed without additional quota.
Current Limit (Dynamic VMs): 0
Current Usage: 0
Amount required: 0
```

#### **Root Cause**
- East US region had zero quota for Function App consumption plans
- Issue was region-specific, not subscription-wide
- Mysterious "Dynamic VMs" quota despite requiring 0 instances

#### **Solution Implemented**
```bash
# Test revealed West US works perfectly
az functionapp create \
  --name "testfunc345643" \
  --consumption-plan-location "westus" \
  --runtime java --runtime-version 17
# ‚úÖ Success!

# Updated default region
location = "westus"  # Instead of "East US"
```

#### **Impact**
- ‚úÖ **Immediate deployment success**
- ‚úÖ **No quota requests required**
- ‚úÖ **Cost-effective consumption plan available**

---

### 4. üîí Network Security & IP Restrictions

#### **Issue Discovered**
```bash
Error: Client address is not authorized and caller is not a trusted service
Status: 403 (Forbidden)
```

#### **Root Cause**
- Key Vault deployed with network restrictions enabled
- Deployer's IP address (193.194.106.45) not in allowed list
- Terraform couldn't complete Key Vault secret creation

#### **Solution Implemented**
```hcl
# Added IP whitelist configuration
variable "allowed_ips" {
  description = "List of IP addresses allowed to access Key Vault"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = []
}

# In terraform.tfvars
allowed_ips = [
  "193.194.106.45/32",  # Deployer IP address
]

# Key Vault network ACLs
network_acls {
  default_action = "Deny"
  ip_rules       = var.allowed_ips
}
```

#### **Impact**
- ‚úÖ **Secure by default** (deny all, allow specific)
- ‚úÖ **Enables successful deployment**
- ‚úÖ **Maintains security posture**

---

### 5. üí∞ Function App Pricing Flexibility

#### **Issue Discovered**
- Consumption plan (Y1) optimal but quota-dependent
- Basic plan (B1) always available but ~3x more expensive
- Need flexibility for different environments/quotas

#### **Root Cause**
- AI initially only configured Consumption plan
- No fallback option for quota limitations
- Cost implications not clearly documented

#### **Solution Implemented**
```hcl
# Added flexible SKU support
variable "function_app_sku" {
  description = "SKU for the Function App service plan"
  type        = string
  default     = "Y1" # Consumption plan
  validation {
    condition = contains([
      "Y1",           # Consumption (~$5-15/month)
      "EP1", "EP2", "EP3",  # Premium
      "B1", "B2", "B3",     # Basic (~$25-35/month)
      "S1", "S2", "S3"      # Standard
    ], var.function_app_sku)
    error_message = "Function App SKU must be supported plan type."
  }
}

# Conditional configuration
always_on = var.function_app_sku != "Y1" # Only for non-consumption
```

#### **Impact**
- ‚úÖ **Cost optimization**: $10-25/month vs $35-50/month
- ‚úÖ **Deployment flexibility** for quota issues
- ‚úÖ **Clear cost implications** documented

---

### 6. üìä Monitoring & Alerting Simplification

#### **Issue Discovered**
```bash
Error: Invalid metric namespace "Microsoft.Insights/components"
Error: Alert rule configuration failed
```

#### **Root Cause**
- AI generated complex metric-based alerts
- Metric namespaces inconsistent during deployment
- Real-time alerts often fail in dev environments

#### **Solution Implemented**
```hcl
# Before (AI generated - complex alerts)
azurerm_monitor_metric_alert "function_failures" {
  metric_namespace = "Microsoft.Insights/components"
  # Complex configuration that often fails
}

# After (Production ready - Log Analytics queries)
azurerm_log_analytics_saved_search "auth_success_rate" {
  category     = "Authentication Monitoring"
  display_name = "Authentication Success Rate"
  query        = <<-EOT
    AppTraces
    | where Message contains "auth"
    | summarize SuccessRate = countif(SeverityLevel <= 1) * 100.0 / count()
  EOT
}
```

#### **Impact**
- ‚úÖ **Reliable monitoring** without deployment failures
- ‚úÖ **Better insights** with custom Log Analytics queries
- ‚úÖ **Development-friendly** approach

## Technical Insights & Best Practices

### **Azure Functions Specifics**
- **Supported Java versions**: 8, 11, 17 only (as of 2024)
- **Consumption plan**: Region-dependent quota availability
- **Always On**: Only applicable to non-consumption plans
- **Cold start optimization**: Automatic with consumption plans

### **Azure Resource Naming**
- **Key Vault**: 24 character maximum (strict)
- **Storage Account**: 24 character maximum, lowercase only
- **Function App**: Can be longer but prefer consistency
- **Best pattern**: `<type>-<project><env><region><suffix>`

### **Regional Considerations**
- **East US**: Often quota-constrained for consumption plans
- **West US**: Generally better availability
- **Testing approach**: Quick region validation before full deployment
```bash
# One-liner quota test
az functionapp create --consumption-plan-location "westus" --runtime java
```

### **Security Configuration**
- **IP whitelisting**: Required for Key Vault network restrictions
- **Managed Identity**: Preferred over connection strings
- **Principle of least privilege**: Deny by default, allow specific

### **Cost Optimization**
| Plan Type | Monthly Cost | Use Case | Availability |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Consumption (Y1) | $5-15 | Development, low usage | Quota-dependent |
| Basic (B1) | $25-35 | Always-on requirements | Always available |
| Premium (EP1) | $150+ | Production workloads | Enterprise |

## Deployment Process Improvements

### **Pre-Deployment Validation**
```bash
# 1. Test region quota availability
az functionapp list-consumption-locations | grep "westus"

# 2. Validate IP address for Key Vault
curl -s ifconfig.me  # Get current public IP

# 3. Check Java version support
az functionapp list-runtimes --os linux | grep java
```

### **Deployment Timeline**
- **Minutes 0-5**: Resource Group, Storage, basics
- **Minutes 5-10**: Key Vault, Application Insights
- **Minutes 10-42**: API Management (longest component)
- **Minutes 42-45**: Function Apps
- **Minutes 45-50**: API configurations

### **Error Recovery Strategies**
1. **Quota issues**: Test alternative regions immediately
2. **Naming conflicts**: Generate new random suffix
3. **Network access**: Verify IP address configuration
4. **Java version**: Always validate against supported versions
