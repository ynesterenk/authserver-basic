# Phase 3: Testing Strategy Summary

## Overview
This phase focuses on creating a comprehensive testing strategy for the Azure-migrated Java Authorization Server, ensuring 90%+ test coverage and validating all functional and non-functional requirements.

## Key Components

### 1. Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Function handlers, repository implementations
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end with Azure services
- **Performance Tests**: Cold start, warm requests, throughput
- **Security Tests**: Credential safety, timing attacks, input validation

### 2. Testing Tools
- JUnit 5 for test framework
- Mockito for mocking Azure SDK components
- Azure Functions Core Tools for local testing
- TestContainers for integration testing (where available)
- JaCoCo for code coverage
- JMH for performance benchmarking

### 3. Test Structure
```

```

### 4. Coverage Requirements
- Line coverage: ≥ 90%
- Branch coverage: ≥ 90%
- All authentication scenarios tested
- Error handling validated
- Performance baseline established

### 5. CI/CD Integration
- Separate test stages in GitHub Actions
- Unit tests run on every commit
- Integration tests run on PR/merge
- Performance tests run nightly
- Coverage reports published

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All test suites created and passing
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds AWS baseline
- [ ] Security tests validate no credential leakage
- [ ] Local development testing workflow documented
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline includes all test stages

## Dependencies
- Phase 1: Infrastructure must be testable locally
- Phase 2: Function implementations complete
- Azure Functions Core Tools installed
- Test data fixtures prepared

## Next Steps
After Phase 3 completion:
- Phase 4: Deployment automation and monitoring
- Performance tuning based on test results
- Security audit based on test findings
