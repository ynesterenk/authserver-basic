# Phase 4: Deployment Automation Summary

## Overview
This phase focuses on creating a complete CI/CD pipeline for the Azure-migrated Java Authorization Server, automating the deployment process from code commit to production-ready infrastructure.

## Key Components

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Triggers**: Push to main branch, PR validation, manual dispatch
- **Jobs**: Test → Security Scan → Build → Deploy Infrastructure → Deploy App → Smoke Test
- **Path Filtering**: Only triggers on authserver.azure/ changes
- **Environment**: Dev environment only (per PRD scope)

### 2. Deployment Scripts
- **deploy-azure.sh**: Terraform deployment and Function app publishing
- **smoke-test-azure.sh**: Endpoint validation and performance checks
- Maintains parity with AWS deployment flow

### 3. Infrastructure Automation
- Terraform for all infrastructure provisioning
- Azure Storage backend for state management
- Modular design from Phase 1 implementation
- Automated rollback capabilities

### 4. Security Features
- Service Principal with least privileges
- Managed Identity for Key Vault access
- All secrets in GitHub Secrets
- Encrypted Terraform state
- OWASP dependency scanning

### 5. Testing & Validation
- Pre-deployment: Unit tests, integration tests, security scans
- Post-deployment: Smoke tests, performance validation
- 90% coverage requirement enforcement
- Automated rollback on test failures

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete GitHub Actions workflow deployed
- [ ] All deployment scripts functional
- [ ] Terraform backend configured
- [ ] Smoke tests passing
- [ ] Deployment time < 15 minutes
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Dependencies
- Phase 1: Terraform modules must be complete
- Phase 2: Function implementations ready
- Phase 3: Test suites available
- Azure subscription and service principal configured
- GitHub secrets configured

## Deliverables
1. `.github/workflows/azure-deploy.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline
2. `scripts/deploy-azure.sh` - Infrastructure and app deployment
3. `scripts/smoke-test-azure.sh` - Post-deployment validation
4. `terraform/backend-config/dev.tfvars` - State management config
5. `docs/deployment-guide.md` - Complete deployment documentation

## Pipeline Flow
```
Code Push → Tests → Security Scan → Build → 
Deploy Terraform → Deploy Functions → Smoke Tests → 
Notification → Success/Rollback
```

## Next Steps
After Phase 4 completion:
- Monitor deployment metrics
- Optimize pipeline performance
- Plan for additional environments (staging/prod)
- Implement advanced monitoring dashboards
- Cost optimization review
