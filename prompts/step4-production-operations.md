# Step 4: Production Operations & Security Hardening

## Objective
Implement comprehensive monitoring, alerting, security hardening, and operational procedures to ensure the Java Authorization Server meets production-grade reliability and security standards.

## Prerequisites
- Step 1-3 completed: Full implementation deployed to production
- All previous validation criteria met
- Infrastructure successfully deployed via CI/CD
- Smoke tests passing in all environments

## Requirements from PRD
- **Availability**: ≥ 99.9% uptime
- **Observability**: Structured JSON logs, CloudWatch metrics, X-Ray tracing
- **Security**: CIS AWS Foundations compliance, credential rotation
- **Reliability**: Automatic retries, DLQ monitoring, alerting
- **Performance**: Monitor cold-start and warm latency targets

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Advanced Monitoring & Alerting

Create comprehensive CloudWatch dashboards and alarms:

**Enhanced Monitoring Stack**:
- Real-time performance metrics dashboard
- Critical error rate alarms (>10 errors in 5 minutes)
- High latency alarms (>120ms P95 for prod)
- Low success rate alarms (<95% authentication success)
- Dead letter queue monitoring
- Custom business metrics (cache hit ratio, auth patterns)

**SNS Integration**:
- Critical alerts → Slack/PagerDuty integration
- Warning alerts → Email notifications
- Automated escalation procedures
- Alert fatigue prevention with smart grouping

### 2. Custom Metrics Implementation

Enhance Lambda handler with detailed metrics:
- Authentication latency (P50, P95, P99)
- Success/failure rates by reason code
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Username hash logging (no PII)
- Request pattern analysis
- Geographic distribution tracking

### 3. Security Hardening

**Enhanced IAM Policies**:
- Least privilege access with resource-based conditions
- Regional restrictions on API calls
- Time-based access controls
- Service-linked role restrictions

**Secrets Management**:
- Customer-managed KMS keys
- Automatic 90-day rotation schedule
- Resource-based policies on secrets
- Audit trail for all secret access

**Network Security**:
- VPC endpoints for AWS services
- Security groups with minimal access
- WAF rules for API Gateway
- DDoS protection configuration

### 4. Operational Runbooks

**Incident Response Procedures**:
- High error rate investigation steps
- Latency spike troubleshooting
- Security incident response
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Escalation matrices and contact lists

**Maintenance Procedures**:
- Deployment rollback procedures
- Secret rotation validation
- Performance tuning guidelines
- Capacity planning processes

### 5. Performance Optimization

**Lambda Optimizations**:
- Memory allocation tuning
- Provisioned concurrency for production
- Connection pooling for AWS SDK
- Cache pre-warming strategies
- Cold start reduction techniques

**Caching Strategy**:
- 5-minute TTL for user credentials
- Proactive cache refresh
- Cache invalidation on secret rotation
- Memory-efficient cache implementation

### 6. Compliance & Audit

**Automated Compliance Checks**:
- Daily security posture validation
- CIS AWS Foundations benchmark compliance
- Encryption at rest verification
- Access pattern anomaly detection
- Compliance reporting automation

**Audit Trail**:
- Comprehensive API access logging
- Authentication attempt tracking
- Administrative action logging
- Compliance violation alerting

## Validation Criteria

### Monitoring Validation
1. **Real-time Dashboards**: All metrics display correctly
2. **Alert Testing**: Simulate failures to verify alert delivery
3. **Performance Tracking**: Latency targets monitored continuously
4. **Business Metrics**: Authentication patterns tracked

### Security Validation
1. **Access Controls**: IAM policies tested and verified
2. **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
3. **Audit Compliance**: All requirements met and automated
4. **Penetration Testing**: Security assessment completed

### Operational Validation
1. **Runbook Testing**: All procedures tested with simulations
2. **Incident Response**: Response times meet SLA requirements
3. **Recovery Procedures**: Disaster recovery tested quarterly
4. **Team Training**: Operations team certified on procedures
